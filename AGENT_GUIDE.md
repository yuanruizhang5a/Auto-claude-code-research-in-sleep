# ARIS Agent Guide

> **For AI agents reading this repo.** If you are a human, see [README.md](README.md).

ARIS is a research harness: composable Markdown skills that orchestrate the ML research lifecycle through cross-model adversarial collaboration.

## How to Invoke Skills

**Claude Code / Cursor / Trae:**
```
/skill-name "arguments" — key: value, key2: value2
```

**Codex CLI:**
```
/skill-name "arguments" — key: value
```
Codex skills are in `skills/skills-codex/`.

## Common Parameters

Every skill accepts:
```
— effort: lite | balanced | max | beast      # work intensity (default: balanced)
— human checkpoint: true | false             # pause for approval (default: false)
— AUTO_PROCEED: true | false                 # auto-continue at gates (default: true)
```

Workflow-specific:
```
— difficulty: medium | hard | nightmare      # reviewer adversarial level
— venue: ICLR | NeurIPS | ICML | ...        # target venue
— sources: web, zotero, deepxiv, ...        # literature sources
— gpu: local | remote | vast | modal         # GPU backend
```

Parameters pass through workflow chains automatically.

## Workflow Index

### Full Pipeline
```
/research-pipeline "direction" → W1 → W1.5 → W2 → W3
```

### Individual Workflows

| Workflow | Invoke | Input | Output | When to use |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|-------------|

| `/analyze-results` | Result analysis | Statistics and comparison tables |
| `/ablation-planner` | Ablation design | Reviewer-perspective ablations |

## Artifact Contracts

Skills communicate through plain-text files:

| Artifact | Created by | Consumed by |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `IDEA_REPORT.md` | idea-discovery | experiment-bridge |
| `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` | experiment-plan | experiment-bridge |
| `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` | experiment-bridge | auto-review-loop, result-to-claim |
| `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` | auto-review-loop | paper-writing |
| `paper/main.tex` | paper-write | paper-compile |
| `paper/main.pdf` | paper-compile | auto-paper-improvement-loop |
| `EXPERIMENT_AUDIT.md` | experiment-audit | result-to-claim |
| `EXPERIMENT_AUDIT.json` | experiment-audit | result-to-claim (machine-readable) |
| `PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.md/.json` | paper-claim-audit | paper-writing Phase 5.5 gate |
| `CITATION_AUDIT.md/.json` | citation-audit | paper-writing Phase 5.8 submission gate |
| `research-wiki/` | research-wiki | idea-creator, research-lit, result-to-claim |
| `.aris/meta/events.jsonl` | hooks (passive) | meta-optimize |

## Cross-Model Protocol

- **Executor** (Claude/Codex): writes code, runs experiments, drafts papers
- **Reviewer** (GPT-5.4/Gemini/GLM): critiques, scores, demands revisions
- **Rule**: executor and reviewer must be different model families
- **Reviewer override**: default is `mcp__codex__codex` xhigh; pass `— reviewer: claude` to use local Claude Code CLI (via `claude-review` MCP) or `— reviewer: oracle-pro` for GPT-5.4 Pro
- **Reviewer independence**: pass file paths only, never summaries or interpretations
- **Experiment integrity**: executor must NOT judge its own eval code — reviewer audits directly

## Shared References

Read these before invoking review-related skills:
- `skills/shared-references/reviewer-independence.md` — cross-model review protocol
- `skills/shared-references/experiment-integrity.md` — prohibited fraud patterns
- `skills/shared-references/effort-contract.md` — effort level specifications
- `skills/shared-references/citation-discipline.md` — citation rules
- `skills/shared-references/writing-principles.md` — writing standards
- `skills/shared-references/venue-checklists.md` — venue formatting

## Research Wiki (Optional)

If `research-wiki/` exists in the project:
- `/research-lit` auto-ingests discovered papers
- `/idea-creator` reads wiki before ideation, writes ideas back after
- `/result-to-claim` updates claim status
- Failed ideas become anti-repetition memory

Initialize with `/research-wiki init`.

## Effort Levels

| Level | Tokens | What changes |
|-------|:------:|-------------|
| `lite` | 0.4x | Fewer papers, ideas, rounds |
| `balanced` | 1x | Current default behavior |
| `max` | 2.5x | More papers, deeper review |
| `beast` | 5-8x | Every knob to maximum |

Codex reasoning is **always xhigh** regardless of effort.

- System-wide rules: read `skills/shared-references/*.md`
